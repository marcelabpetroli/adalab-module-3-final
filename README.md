# Rick and Morty Characters Finder

This project was created for the final individual evaluation of the React Module of Adalab's Web Development Bootcamp.

The objective was to develop a web page with a list of Rick and Morty characters, which the user can filter in different ways, by name, species, location, etc. By clicking in each character a new page opens with more details.

## Specifications
